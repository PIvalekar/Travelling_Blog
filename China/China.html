                <img src="/china/images/the great wall1.jpg" alt="the great wall1" width="70%" height="500">
                <p class="my-4">The Great Wall of China, is a series of fortifications that were built across the
                    historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against
                    various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th
                    century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the
                    first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built
                    and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by
                    the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
                    Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the
                    imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade
                    and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the
                    Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations,
                    signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great
                    Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
                    The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch
                    from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the
                    north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the
                    Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total. Today, the defensive system
                    of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in
                    history.

                    non-profit research and breeding facility for giant pandas and other rare animals. It is located in
                    Chengdu, Sichuan, China.
                    Chengdu Panda Base was founded in 1987. It started with 6 giant pandas that were rescued from the
                    wild. By 2008, it had 124 panda births, and the captive panda population has grown to 83.[1][2]
                    Its stated goal is to "be a world-class research facility, conservation education center, and
                    international educational tourism destination.

                    China and is the location of the seat of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, bordering Sichuan
                    to the northwest, north, and east.
                    Shangri-La was formerly called Zhongdian County but was renamed on 17 December 2001 and upgraded
                    into a county-level city on 16 December 2014 as Shangri-La after the fictional land of Shangri-La in
                    the 1933 James Hilton novel Lost Horizon, in an effort to promote tourism in the area. Formerly, the
                    Tibetan population referred to the city by its traditional name Gyalthang or Gyaitang, meaning
                    "Royal plains". This ancient name is reflected in the Tibetan Pinyin name within the town of
                    Jiantang, the city seat.

                    Anhui Province in eastern China. It was originally called “Yishan”, and it was renamed because of a
                    legend that Emperor Xuanyuan once made alchemy here. Vegetation on the range is thickest below 1,100
                    meters (3,600 ft), with trees growing up to the treeline at 1,800 meters (5,900 ft).
                    The area is well known for its scenery, sunsets, peculiarly-shaped granite peaks, Huangshan pine
                    trees, hot springs, winter snow and views of the clouds from above. Huangshan is a frequent subject
                    of traditional Chinese paintings and literature, as well as modern photography. It is a UNESCO World

                <p class="my-4">The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin
                    Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in
                    210–209 BCE with the purpose of protecting the emperor in his afterlife.
                    The figures, dating from approximately the late third century BCE, were discovered in 1974 by
                    local farmers in Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. The figures vary in height according
                    to their roles, the tallest being the generals. The figures include warriors, chariots and horses.
                    Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army held more than 8,000
                    soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remained
                    buried in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. Other terracotta non-military figures were
                    found in other pits, including officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians.
                    The tomb appears to be a hermetically sealed space roughly the size of a football pitch (c. 100 × 75
                    m). The tomb remains unopened, possibly due to concerns over preservation of its artifacts. For
                    example, after the excavation of the Terracotta Army, the painted surface present on some terracotta
                    figures began to flake and fade. The lacquer covering the paint can curl in fifteen seconds once
                    exposed to Xi'an's dry air and can flake off in just four minutes.

                    and the Jingshan Park.
                    The Forbidden City was constructed from 1406 to 1420, and was the former Chinese imperial palace and
                    winter residence of the Emperor of China from the Ming dynasty (since the Yongle Emperor) to the end
                    of the Qing dynasty, between 1420 and 1924.
                    It is listed by UNESCO as the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the
                    world. Since 2012, the Forbidden City has seen an average of 14 million visitors annually, and
                    received more than 19 million visitors in 2019.
                    The Forbidden City in Beijing is one of the largest and most well-preserved ancient wooden
                    structures in the world. It was listed as the first batch of national key cultural relics in 1961.

                    three causeways. There are numerous temples, pagodas, gardens, and natural/artificial islands within
                    the lake. Gushan is the largest natural island and three artificial islands: Xiaoyingzhou, Huixin
                    Pavilion, and Ruan Gongdunstand at the middle of the lake. Leifeng Pagoda and Baochu Pagoda are
                    separated by the lake. Mirroring each other, the basic pattern of "one mountain, two towers, three
                    islands, three banks, and five lakes" is formed.
                    West Lake has influenced poets and painters throughout Chinese history for its natural beauty and
                    historic relics, and it has also been among the most important sources of inspiration for Chinese
                    garden designers. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, described as having "influenced
                    garden design in the rest of China as well as Japan and Korea over the centuries" and reflecting "an

                    strategic location on South China Sea were instrumental in Hong Kong's establishment as a British
                    colony in 1841 and its subsequent development as a trading centre.
                    The harbour is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong. Lying in the middle of the territory's dense
                    urban region, the harbour is the site of annual fireworks displays and its promenades are used as
                    gathering places for residents and also tourists.
