                <img src="/Greece/images/athens.jpg" alt="Alhambra" width="70%" height="500">
                <p class="my-4">Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and
                    is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its
                    earliest human presence beginning somewhere between the 11th and 7th centuries BC.
                    Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. It was a centre for the arts, learning and philosophy,
                    and the home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. It is widely referred to as the cradle of
                    Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy.
                    The heritage of the Classical Era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments,
                    and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early
                    Western civilization. The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller
                    number of Ottoman monuments, while its historical urban core features elements of continuity through
                    its millennia of history.

                    alt="Generalife" width="70%" height="500">
                <p class="my-4">Chania is a city in Greece and the capital of the Chania regional unit. It lies along
                    the north west coast of the island Crete, about 70 km (43 mi) west of Rethymno and 145 km (90 mi)
                    west of Heraklion.
                    The borders of the Old Town are the partly destroyed old Venetian wall (and bulwarks) and this has
                    been the cradle of all the civilizations which were developed in the area. The central part of the
                    old town is named Kasteli and has been inhabited since Neolithic times
                    The modern part of Chania is where most locals live and work. It is less traditional than the old
                    town, but there are still areas of some historical interest.
                    The oldest district (early 18th century) of the modern city is Nea Hora (meaning "New Town") which
                    is located beyond the west end of the old town. It is a developing area with narrow old lanes
                    leading to a small fishing harbour.

                <p class="my-4">Santorini, officially Thira and classic Greek Thera, is an island in the southern Aegean
                    Sea, about 200 km southeast from the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular
                    archipelago, which bears the same name and is the remnant of a caldera.
                    The island was the site of one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history: the Minoan
                    eruption (sometimes called the Thera eruption), which occurred about 3,600 years ago at the height
                    of the Minoan civilization.

                    from every point of the village of Mykonos, the island's principal village, which is frequently
                    called the Chora on Greek islands. The windmills are the first thing seen when coming into the
                    harbour of Alefkandra, as they stand on a hill overlooking the area.
                    There are currently 16 windmills on Mykonos of which seven are positioned on the landmark hill in
                    Chora. The whole village of Chora and part of the harbour are visible from this point.

                    The town's name is thought to come from an ancient temple of Apollo on the site of the church of

                    temple of Apollo's sister-goddess Artemis, located at the site of the church of Panayia Kokhi.
                    The village of Kastro, was the capital of the island during ancient times until 1836. It is built on
