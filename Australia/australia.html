                    The 26-hectare (64-acre) site contains the Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne Museum and Imax
                    Cinema, tennis courts and an award-winning children's playground. The rectangular site is bound by
                    Victoria Street, Rathdowne Street, Carlton Street, and Nicholson Street.
                    The gardens are an example of Victorian landscape design with sweeping lawns and varied European and
                    Australian tree plantings consisting of deciduous English oaks, White Poplar, plane trees, elms,
                    conifers, cedars, turkey oaks, Araucarias and evergreens such as Moreton Bay figs, combined with
                    flower beds of annuals and shrubs. A network of tree-lined paths provides formal avenues for
                    highlighting the fountains and architecture of the Exhibition building. This includes the grand
                    allee of plane trees that lead to the exhibition building. Two small ornamental lakes adorn the
                    southern section of the park. The northern section contains the museum, tennis courts, maintenance
                    depot and curator's cottage, and the children's playground designed as a Victorian maze. Dramatic
                    tree-lined avenues, a majestic fountain, formal flowerbeds and miniature lakes are features of these
                    late nineteenth century Gardens.

                    New South Wales, Australia, and is the tallest mountain range in mainland Australia, being part of
                    the continent's Great Dividing Range cordillera system.
                    The Snowy Mountains experiences large natural snowfalls every winter, normally during June, July,
                    August and early September, with the snow cover melting by late spring. It is considered to be one
                    of the centers of the Australian ski industry during the winter months, with all four snow resorts
                    in New South Wales being located in the region. The range is host to the mountain plum-pine, a
                    low-lying type of conifer.
