                    Japan, standing 3,776.24 m (12,389.2 ft). It is the second-highest volcano located on an island in

                    Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707 to 1708.
                    Mount Fuji is one of Japan's "Three Holy Mountains" along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a
                    Special Place of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites. It was added to the World Heritage
                    List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013.
